# basic-chatapp
This is a basic socket chatapp. the backend is only coded. 
Hence, needds to interact with it by postman.

# review/regret
- need to build the frontend with React or Next. However, Qt or tkinter might be better for that because 
API slows down the real time chat.
- socketio facilitates building a live chatapp, so need to rebuild it with it.
- The security of this app is aweful, so need to crypt it with RSA.
